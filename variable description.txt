Data Discription - The data was collected from accelerometer and gyroscope readings of Samsung Galaxy S II smartphones affixed to the waists of 30 test subjects engaged in varying activities characterized as walking, walking up stairs, walking down stairs, sitting, standing, and laying.  

Variable Description - There are two variants of the variables - those prefixed with 't' as temporal and those which have undergone Fourier transformation, prefixed with an 'f'.

For each of three axes (X, Y, Z), the temporal variables groups are:
    
          tBodyAcc - Body Acceleration
       tGravityAcc - Gravity Acceleration
      tBodyAccJerk - Body Acceleration Jerk
         tBodyGyro - Body Angular Acceleration
     tBodyGyroJerk - Body Angular Acceleration Jerk

The euclidean magnitude of these measure is contained in the variables groups:

       tBodyAccMag - Magnitude of Body Acceleration
    tGravityAccMag - Magnitude of Gravity Acceleration
   tBodyAccJerkMag - Magnitude of Body Acceleration Jerk
      tBodyGyroMag - Magnitude of Body Angular Acceleration
  tBodyGyroJerkMag - Magnitude of Body Angular Acceleration Jerk

Finaly the Fourier transformed variable groups are given as;

          fBodyAcc - Fourier Transform of Body Acceleration
      fBodyAccJerk - Fourier Transform of Body Acceleration Jerk
         fBodyGyro - Fourier Transform of Body Angular Acceleration
       fBodyAccMag - Fourier Transform of Magnitude of Gravity Acceleration
   fBodyAccJerkMag - Fourier Transform of Magnitude of Body Acceleration Jerk
      fBodyGyroMag - Fourier Transform of Magnitude of Body Angular Acceleration
  fBodyGyroJerkMag - Fourier Transform of Magnitude of Body Angular Acceleration Jerk

Of the 17 specific measure contained in each of these groups (mean(), std(), mad(), max(), min(), sma(), energy(), iqr(), entropy(), arCoeff(), correlation(), maxInds(), meanFreq(), skewness(), kurtosis(), bandsEnergy(), and angle()), we subset only the values given for mean and standard deviation (mean() and std()).
